A set of scripts to automate some Steganography tasks, mostly for CTF challenges

use pillow to output color-modified versions of the original image, which will be fed into different image processing modules e.g. tesseract, zbar, ect. to search images for text, QR codes, barcodes, ect. 


Essentially brute force stego solving
